## BRICK BREAKER

The game is in Java 8, uses JavaFX for the front end and uses simple collision detection algorithm(Separating axis theorem) for keeping tracks of points scored. To run the application you need Java 8. For setting up Java 8 on your system follow these steps:

 1. Download the Java 8 SDK from the oracle website or any other open source version
 2. Add the Java bin directory to the Path environment variable.

I recommend to follow the installation instruction mentioned on the site you download SDK from as these varies for each open source versions.

To run the application:

  1. Browse to the directory and open cmd there.
  2. Compile the application as:
        <code>javac Game.java</code>
  3. Run the application as:
        <code>java Game</code>
